                <p>If you feel this to be an error, please contact your local network administrator.
                   This is the person who installed the cleanwall firewall router. Please provide details.
                   Such as what you were trying to do online and what exact page you were trying to call.
                   And last but not least, the boldface text of this error message and it's top most title. <br />

                </p>
                <p>This page should normally come from your Cleanmedia Cleanwall security firewall router.
                   If you are sure, this is your router and you are not being hacked right now, it is safe
                   to download and trust the following root certificate authority (to avoid future complaints of your browser).
                   Also the cleanwall root CA key should have been recreated by the system administrator before.
                   Otherwise everybody who knows you are using a cleanwall and that you are too lazy to recreate your keys,
                   can easily steal your credit card data or anything else you are using over the Internet.
                   So if you feel safe about using this combination of cleanwall and browser for the first time,
                   you can download and trust this cleanwall self signed CA here: <a href=cleanwall_rootCA.pem>cleanwall_rootCA.pem</a>
